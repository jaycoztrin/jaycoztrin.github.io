Tax will apply when you pay through a t-shirt, but not when you pay through a group.</li><li><i>Can Jayleigh do everything?</i><br><br><b>No.</b>&nbsp;Jayleigh can not do everything. She is still learning, and she is trying to do everything to the best of her abilities.</li><li><i>Why is Jayleigh taking so long on my commission?</i><br><br>Jayleigh is very busy with work and school even in the summer, so please be patient and Jayleigh will get to your commission soon!</li><li><i>Why can't I order more than one commission at a time?</i><br><br>The reason why you can’t order more than one commission at a time is so Jayleigh doesn’t get too overwhelmed with your commissions. Jayleigh would like to get to everyone and not just one person.</li><li><i>Why do I need to pay extra robux when I pay for my commission?</i><br><br>Unfortunately, Roblox takes a “tax” on any sold item, for t-shirts it’s 30% of the final price. So for Jayleigh to receive the correct amount of robux and counteract this tax more robux is required.</li></ol></section></body></html>
